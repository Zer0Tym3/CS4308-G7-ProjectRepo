Repo Containing Folders for Each Deliverable

CS4308-G7-ProjectDeliverable1 == Python Code (What we Plan On Turning In)

Sorry for the Poor Naming Conventions

For Python Deliverable1:
Token Class:

What is Needs to Do:

4. Tokenize the Following:

   d. special characters (commas, periods, etc.)
5. Add each token created from the SCL file to a list/array
6. Print the token list/array to the console.
7. Export the token list/array to a JSON File.
